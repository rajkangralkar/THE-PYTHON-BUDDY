# 🤖 AutoCode T5 – Text to Code Generator

**AutoCode T5** is an AI-powered **text-to-code generation system** built using the **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)** architecture.  
The model converts **natural language descriptions into executable source code**, helping developers automate coding tasks and improve productivity.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

AutoCode T5 takes a human-readable programming prompt as input and generates syntactically correct and meaningful code as output.  
The system is trained and fine-tuned on code–text pairs to understand programming logic and structure.
